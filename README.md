## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. **Unemployment Rate Over Time – State Level**
- Focused on **Andhra Pradesh** as a case study.
- Line plot showed clear spike during **April–June 2020**.
- Urban areas more severely impacted than rural.

### 2. **Unemployment by Region**
- Boxplots revealed regional differences.
- **Delhi, Bihar, Tamil Nadu** showed wider distributions and spikes.

### 3. **Urban vs Rural Comparison**
- Histogram analysis showed higher **variance in urban unemployment**.
- Rural zones were more stable due to agriculture-based employment.

### 4. **Correlation Matrix**
- Strong **negative correlation** between unemployment rate and employment count.
- Labour participation rate showed **positive correlation** with employment.

### 5. **Before vs After Lockdown**
- Compared Jan–Mar vs Apr–Jun data.
- **Puducherry** saw a drastic increase from ~1% to ~46%.
- Most states showed significant post-lockdown unemployment rises.

##  Key Insights

- **Lockdown Impact**: Every state saw a rise in unemployment; worst-hit were Bihar, Delhi, Tripura, and Puducherry.
- **Urban vs Rural Divide**: Urban areas experienced more volatility and loss.
- **Regional Trends**: Northern and Eastern regions were more affected than Southern states.
- **Economic Resilience**: States with rural, agriculture-heavy economies fared better (e.g., Chhattisgarh, Assam).
- **Statistical Relationships**: Unemployment rate inversely linked to employment and labour participation.
