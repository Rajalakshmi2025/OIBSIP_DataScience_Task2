# Unemployment Rate Analysis During COVID-19

##  Internship Project - Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP)
**Task 2- Data Science Domain**

---
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate — the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. We saw a sharp increase in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project analyzes the changing patterns in unemployment and visualizes them using data science tools.

---

##  Objective

The aim of this project is to analyze unemployment trends in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using real-world data, we explore how unemployment rates varied over time, regions, and other demographic factors. The goal is to provide insights into the socio-economic impact of the pandemic.

Used unemployment dataset

-**Data Cleaning**
Handled missing data and ensured the dataset was analysis-ready.

-**Exploratory Data Analysis**
Performed univariate and multivariate analysis of state-wise unemployment rates.

-**Data Visualization**
Created insightful bar charts, heatmaps, and time series plots to understand unemployment trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. **Unemployment Rate Over Time – State Level**
- Focused on **Andhra Pradesh** as a case study.
- Line plot showed clear spike during **April–June 2020**.
- Urban areas more severely impacted than rural.

### 2. **Unemployment by Region**
- Boxplots revealed regional differences.
- **Delhi, Bihar, Tamil Nadu** showed wider distributions and spikes.

### 3. **Urban vs Rural Comparison**
- Histogram analysis showed higher **variance in urban unemployment**.
- Rural zones were more stable due to agriculture-based employment.

### 4. **Correlation Matrix**
- Strong **negative correlation** between unemployment rate and employment count.
- Labour participation rate showed **positive correlation** with employment.

### 5. **Before vs After Lockdown**
- Compared Jan–Mar vs. Apr–Jun unemployment across states.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Bihar: 12% → 37%
  - Delhi: 18% → 25%
  - Puducherry: ~1% → ~46% (highest spike)
  - Less-affected states: Chhattisgarh, Assam, Odisha
- Most states showed significant post-lockdown unemployment rises.

---

##  Highlights

- **Significant Post-Lockdown Spike**: Unemployment rose drastically across India after lockdown in 2020.
- **Regional Variations**:
  - North & East India faced harsher unemployment impact.
  - South India remained more stable.
- **Urban vs Rural Divide**:
  - Urban areas more severely impacted due to dependency on services and industry.
- **Economic Vulnerabilities**:
  - States with tourism, hospitality, or industrial reliance (like Puducherry, Tamil Nadu) were hit hardest.
